The Mana world examples will demonstrate quite a lot of different Automapping
features. At first a shoreline will be constructed, by first adding all
the straight parts and afterwards another rule will correct the corners
to make them also fit the given tileset. After the shoreline has been added,
the waters will be marked as unwalkable for the game engine. Last but not least
some random placed fancy flowers will make the scenary even more beautiful.
