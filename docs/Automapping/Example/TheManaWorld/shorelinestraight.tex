This example will demonstrate how a straight shoreline can easily be setup 
between shallow water grass tiles. In this example we will only implement the
shoreline, which has grass in southern and water in northern direction.

So basically the meaning we will define in the input region is 
\emph{All tiles which are south of a water tile and are no water tiles itself,
will be replaced by a shoreline tile}

The region in which this Automapping rule should be defined is of 2 tiles in height and 
1 tile in width. Therefore we need a layer called \emph{regions} and it will have 2 tiles placed
to indicate this region. In figure~\ref{shorelinestraight} the top graphics shows such a region
layer.

The input layer called \emph{input\_Ground} is depicted in the middle of 
figure~\ref{shorelinestraight}. Only the upper tile is filled by the water
tile. The lower tile contains no tile. It is not an invisible tile, just no
tile at all. 

And whenever there is no tile in a place within the rule regions in an input layer,
what kind of tiles will be allowed there? There will be allowed any tiles except 
all used tiles within all input layer with the same index and name.

Here we only have one tile layer as an input layer carrying only the water tile.
Hence at the position, where no tile is located, all tiles except that water tile
are allowed.
